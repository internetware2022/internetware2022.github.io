            <h3>Special Section/Issue on Intelligent Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>Software systems have been playing important roles in business, scientific research, and our
                everyday lives. It
                is
                critical to improve both software productivity and quality, which are major challenges to
                software engineering
                researchers and practitioners. As developers work on a project, they leave behind many
                digital artifacts. These
                digital trails can provide insights into how software is developed and provide a rich source
                of information to
                help
                improve development practices. For instance, GitHub hosts more than 57M repositories, and is
                currently used by
                more
                than 20M developers. As another example, Stack Overflow has more than 3.9M registered users,
                8.8M questions, and
                41M
                comments. The productivity of software developers and testers can be improved using
                information from these
                repositories.</p>
            <p>In recent years, software engineering is benefiting from the rise of Artificial Intelligence
                (AI) techniques
                (e.g.,
                machine learning and deep learning). These techniques have shown a great success in
                addressing various software
                engineering problems (e.g., code generation, code recommendation, and bug fix and repair).
                Many papers have
                applied
                AI techniques to discover knowledge or build intelligent tools from software artifacts
                (e.g., specifications,
                source
                code, documentations, execution logs, code commits and bug reports) to improve software
                quality and development
                process. Mining high quality knowledge from software artifacts is critical to building AI
                tools. Thus, mining
                software repositories to learn predictive and quality models is an important part in
                intelligent software
                engineering. For this special issue, we seek the full potential of AI on improving both
                software productivity
                and
                quality.</p>

            <p>We invite the submission of high-quality papers describing original and significant work in
                all areas of
                intelligent
                software engineering including (but not limited to): 1) Methodological and technical
                foundations of intelligent
                software engineering, 2) Approaches and techniques for knowledge discovery in various
                software artefacts, and 3)
                Applications of AI techniques to facilitate specialized tasks in software engineering.
