### Call for Papers

Internet is open, dynamic, and meets a constantly changing environment. Software, being architected like the Internet, developed with the Internet, operated on the Internet, connects the human, cyber, and physical world. Internetware ought to be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, and trustworthy, but these requirements pose unique challenges for software technologies to support Internetware's construction, deployment, and use.

This symposium aims to provide an interactive forum where researchers and professionals from multiple disciplines and domains meet and exchange ideas to explore and address the challenges brought by Internetware.

Internetware 2022 will be held June 11-12 in Huhhot, China. We solicit submissions describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research related to Internetware. Topics of interests include but are not limited to:

* Novel software paradigm for Internetware
* Modeling and implementation of Internetware
* Requirements engineering for Internetware
* Software analysis, verification and testing
* Mining software repositories
* Software dependability, trustworthiness and confidence
* Software architecture and design
* Crowd-based methods, techniques and tools for Internetware
* Social-technical models and techniques
* Software ecosystem practices and experiences
* Software models and techniques for Internet-based systems such as Cloud Computing, Service Computing, Social commputing, Mobile Internet, Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems
* Software engineering for/with Big data
* Software engineering for/with Artificial Intelligence

### Main Conference

Following types of papers are welcomed to Internetware 2022:

* **<u>Technical research papers</u>** for solid technical contributions to Internetware. Technical research papers must not exceed 10 pages for all text, figures, tables, and references. 
* **<u>Short papers</u>** for early announcements on breaking research results. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages for all text, figures, tables, and references. 
* **<u>Short papers (no proceeding)</u>**. The requirements are the same as short papers. Authors are required to give oral presentations. However, papers in this track will not appear in the proceedings.

Best papers submitted to the technical research track will be selected and invited to submit an extended version to the [Journal of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.springer.com/journal/11390). All the extended submissions will be evaluated following the guidelines set by the corresponding journal. Only those satisfying all the criteria will be accepted for the journal publication.

### Special Tracks

Best papers submitted to a special track will be first accept to Internetware 2022 proceedings, and then be invited to submit an extended version to the corresponding journals. All the extended submissions will be evaluated following the guidelines set by the corresponding journal. Only those satisfying all the criteria will be accepted for the journal publication.
