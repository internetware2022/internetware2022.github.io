### Introduction

With the Internetware paradigm, the software is architected like the Internet, developed with the Internet, operated on the Internet, and provided as services via the Internet. In the open, dynamic, and constantly changing environment of Internet, Internetware systems need to be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, and trustworthy. These requirements pose special challenges for software technologies to support the construction, deployment, and use of software applications based on Internet that not only of computers, but also of things and human users.

This symposium aims to provide an interactive forum where researchers and professionals from multiple disciplines and domains meet and exchange ideas to explore and address the challenges brought by Internetware.

Internetware 2022 will be held June 11-12 in Huhhot, China. We solicit submissions describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research related to Internetware. Topics of interests include but are not limited to:

* Novel software paradigm for Internetware
* Modeling and implementation of Internetware
* Requirements engineering for Internetware
* Software analysis, verification and testing
* Mining software repositories
* Software dependability, trustworthiness and confidence
* Software architecture and design
* Crowd-based methods, techniques and tools for Internetware
* Social-technical models and techniques
* Software ecosystem practices and experiences
* Software models and techniques for Internet-based systems such as Cloud Computing, Service Computing, Social commputing, Mobile Internet, Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems
* Software engineering for/with Big data
* Software engineering for/with Artificial Intelligence

### Special Tracks

Internetware 2020 organized several special tracks in collaboration with multiple
 top-tier transactions/journals, including <a
     href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=24">IEEE
     Transactions on Reliability</a>, SOSYM, Cyber Security and Journal of
 Information and Software Technology. Papers submitted into the main track will be
 selected and invited to submit an extended version of their papers to the IEEE
 Transactions on Reliability. All the extended submissions will be evaluated
 following the guidelines set by the corresponding journal. Only those satisfying all
 the criteria will be accepted for the journal publication.</p>

Papers submitted and accepted by the corresponding special tracks will be published
 in the Internetware 2020 proceeding firstly, and be invited to submit an extended
 version of their papers to the corresponding journals. All the extended submissions
 will be evaluated following the guidelines set by the corresponding journal. Only
 those satisfying all the criteria will be accepted for the journal publication.</p>
