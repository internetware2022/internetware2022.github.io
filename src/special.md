### Special Sections/Issues

We are excited to announce two special sections for Internetware'22:

- Special Section/Issue on Intelligent Software Engineering
- Special Section/Issue on Evolving Large-scale Systems

### 1. Special Section/Issue on Intelligent Software Engineering

**Best papers will be invited to “Automated Software Engineering: An International Journal!”**

Software systems have been playing important roles in business, scientific research, and our everyday lives. It is critical to improve both software productivity and quality, which are major challenges to software engineering researchers and practitioners. As developers work on a project, they leave behind many digital artifacts. These digital trails can provide insights into how software is developed and provide a rich source of information to help improve development practices. For instance, GitHub hosts more than 57M repositories, and is currently used by more than 20M developers. As another example, Stack Overflow has more than 3.9M registered users, 8.8M questions, and 41M comments. The productivity of software developers and testers can be improved using information from these repositories.

In recent years, software engineering is benefiting from the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (e.g., machine learning and deep learning). These techniques have shown a great success in addressing various software engineering problems (e.g., code generation, code recommendation, and bug fix and repair). Many papers have applied AI techniques to discover knowledge or build intelligent tools from software artifacts (e.g., specifications, source code, documentations, execution logs, code commits and bug reports) to improve software quality and development process. Mining high quality knowledge from software artifacts is critical to building AI tools. Thus, mining software repositories to learn predictive and quality models is an important part in intelligent software engineering. For this special issue, we seek the full potential of AI on improving both software productivity and quality.

We invite the submission of high-quality papers describing original and significant work in all areas of intelligent software engineering including (but not limited to): 1) Methodological and technical foundations of intelligent software engineering, 2) Approaches and techniques for knowledge discovery in various software artifacts, and 3) Applications of AI techniques to facilitate specialized tasks in software engineering. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

**A. Intelligent software engineering techniques**

- AI models and techniques for software engineering
- Robust and highly scalable algorithms for mining ultra-large-scale software systems
- Explainable and actionable AI models
- Visualizing AI models

**B. Knowledge discovery in software artifacts**

- Mining software specifications
- Mining source code/code commits
- Mining execution traces and logs
- Mining bug and crash reports
- Mining Q&A and social data

**C. Intelligent software engineering in specialized tasks**

- AI techniques for software development and reuse
- AI techniques for software maintenance and evolution
- AI techniques for software testing and debugging
- AI techniques for open-source ecosystem best practices
- AI techniques for better requirement reasoning and refinement
- AI techniques for program repair

#### Submission

To speed up the review process, and to encourage people to join the [Internetware 2022](https://internetware2022.github.io/) conference (in Hohhot, China), we setup two rounds of reviews: an Internetware conference round, and a journal round.

In the Internetware conference round, authors are encouraged to submit their manuscripts to the [Easychair submission site](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=internetware2022), You should choose “Intelligent Software Engineering Track” in Easychair. The submissions must have not been previously published or considered for publication elsewhere. Each submission must not exceed 10 pages for all text, figures, tables, and references. All submissions must be in English and in PDF format. Please use the ACM Master article template, as can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template pages. Each submission will receive at least three high-quality reviews from our PCs. Each accepted submission must be accompanied by a registration of at least one author and presented at Internetware 2022.

And in the journal round, only the selected best papers will be invited to submit their revisions to the Automated Software Engineering journal. You should choose SI:TBD. The authors should carefully address the comments from the Internetware conference reviewers and prepare a response letter. And these papers will be reviewed by the same three reviewers. Note that only the selected best papers from the Internetware conference round will get invited for possible journal publication.

### 2. Special Section/Issue on Evolving Large-scale Systems

**Best papers will be invited to “Journal of Software: Evolution and Process!”**

Software systems, particularly large-scale systems that underwent long-term maintenance and evolution, are the foundation of the modern Internet era. However, these systems are still not rock solid and are vulnerable to delayed releases, defects, cyber-attacks, etc. Such vulnerabilities may cast significant impact on our daily lives or even catastrophic consequences. Unfortunately, it is still an open challenge towards the effective construction and maintenance of such systems due to their complexities and the continuously evolving property. 

This special issue focuses on fundamental large-scale software systems, including (but not limited to) operating systems, cloud/distributed systems, middlewares, databases, and server systems. Understanding and characterizing the evolution of such systems can lead to more reliable software systems, and may also pave the path for the new generations of software systems. In particular,  this special issue has a strong emphasis on two aspects, “evolution” and “practicality”. On the one side, this special issue has a special focus on the systems’ dynamics over time, aiming to dissecting the challenges, problems and side effects induced by the continuously evolution of such large-scale systems. On the other side, it expects “practical” solutions, such as novel software architectures, scalable testing methods, debugging and diagnosis techniques, to tackle the challenges of evolving large-scale systems.

We call for high-quality original research papers that address the fundamental challenges in the maintenance and evolution of large-scale systems. This special issue will blend standalone submissions and the best papers from the Journal Special Track of the 13th Asia-Pacific Conference on Internetware. Welcomed topics include but are not limited to:

- Empirical studies on the maintenance and evolution of large-scale systems
- Artifact management and continuous integration/deployment for large-scale systems
- Novel software design and architecture for large-scale systems
- Scalable software testing, analysis, validation, and verification for large-scale systems
- Debugging and failure diagnosis for large-scale systems
- Artificial intelligence for/with large-scale systems
- Software ecosystems: practices and experiences

#### Submission

**The Internetware Journal Track**: Submit via easy [Easychair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=internetware2022) and select the “Evolving large-scale systems” Track.
