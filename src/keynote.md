        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <b>Reproducibility is the ability of recreating identical binaries under pre-defined build environments. Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying and fixing the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this talk we first propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. Furthermore, we instigate how to automatically patch for unreproducible builds. Fixing unreproducible build issues poses a set of challenges within the reproducible builds practice, among which we consider the localization granularity and the historical knowledge utilization as the most significant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach RepFix that combines tracing-based fine-grained localization with history-based patch generation mechanisms. To evaluate the usefulness of RepFix, extensive experiments are conducted over a dataset with 116 real-world packages. Based on RepFix, we successfully fix the unreproducible build issues for 62 packages.

        <h4><a href=""  target="_blank">Prof. Marieke Huisman</a> </h4>
        <h4>University of Twente, the Netherlands</h4>
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <b>In this talk I will present our approach to reason about concurrent software based on permission-based separation logic. I will briefly describe the fundamentals of deductive software verification, and then discuss what is needed to use this approach for concurrent and distributed software. In particular, for concurrent and distributed software the program annotations have to take care of what part of the memory is affected by a thread or process. I will show how permission-based separation logic is particularly suitable for this. I will show how this is supported by the VerCors program verifier, and discuss some of the case studies that have been done with VerCors. A main characteristic of the VerCors verifier is that it can reason about different kinds of concurrent programs. In particular, VerCors was originally developed to reason about Java programs, but it can also be used to reason about OpenCL kernels (for GPU), or to prove that compiler directives for parallellisation, such as in OpenMP, are correct.
        I will also provide an outlook on how the VerCors approach might be usable for internetware.

        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <b>Marieke Huisman is a professor in Software Reliability at the University of Twente. She is well-known for her work on program verification of concurrent software. In 2011, she obtained an ERC Starting Grant, which she used to start development of the VerCors verifier, a tool for the verification of concurrent software. Currently, as part of her NWO personal VICI grant Mercedes, she is working on further improving verification techniques, both by enabling the verification of a larger class of properties, and by making verification more automatic. Since 2019 she is SC chair of ETAPS. Besides her scientific work, she also actively works on topics related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
