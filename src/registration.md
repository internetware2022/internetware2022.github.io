### Registration Information
The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation, Internetware 2022 will take place as an online conference on Jun. 11-12, 2022, instead of an in-person conference in Hohhot, China. We look forward to seeing you! 

There are two types of registration for Internetware 2022: Author and Attendee. At least one author for each accepted paper must complete an Author Registration in order for the paper to be included in the conference proceedings.
