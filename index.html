                                        Internet provides a global open infrastructure for exchanging and sharing of
                                        various
                                        resources for the people all over the world. The rapid development and the wide
                                        application of Internet make it become a new mainstream platform for software to
                                        be
                                        used, developed, deployed and executed. With the vision of “Internet as
                                        computer”,
                                        many application styles such as pervasive computing, grid computing, service
                                        computing and cloud computing occur on this open and dynamic environment. In
                                        order
                                        to support various new application styles and accommodate the fundamental change
                                        of
                                        the underlying supporting platform, many specific software technologies such as
                                        service-oriented architecture are proposed for current practices. However,
                                        although
                                        these technologies are useful and popular, they are far from systematic and
                                        complete
                                        because no uniformed software methodology and technology system like the
                                        object-oriented one is provided.

                                        Conceptually speaking, in order to adapt the software system to such a new
                                        environment, its structure model should be autonomous, cooperative, situational,
                                        evolvable, emergent, trustworthy, etc. The software entities dispersed on
                                        distributed nodes over the Internet, which evolved from objects in
                                        object-oriented
                                        methodology to software components (component-based software development), now
                                        are
                                        further turned into self-contained, autonomous and adaptive software services in
                                        service-oriented computing of state-of-arts. These software entities are
                                        coordinated
                                        statically and dynamically in various kinds of interaction styles (passively and
                                        actively) such as integration, cooperation, and orchestration to achieve

                                        design objectives. So a so-called “software-web” instead of information-web is
                                        weaved. This software-web as a whole is able to perceive the changes of open,
                                        dynamic, and uncertain environment and respond them in the way of transforming
                                        architectures. Furthermore, the flexible design objective of the software-web is
                                        reflected by its exhibiting several compatible goal-directed behaviors according
                                        to
                                        its up-to-date knowledge about the outside environment. A portmanteau term
                                        “Internetware” is used to denote the future software-web in open and dynamic
                                        environment, which can be defined as follows: an Internetware system is a

                                        system consists of the self-contained, autonomous entities situated in the
                                        distributed nodes of Internet and the coordinators connecting these entities
                                        statically and dynamically in various kinds of interaction styles (passively and
                                        actively). As a whole, an Internetware system is able to perceive the changes of
                                        open and dynamic environment such as Internet, respond to the changes in the way

                                                learning. Such systems typically contain components relying on machine
                                                learning, whose behavior is not specified or coded but driven by
                                                training data, but which interact with other components in the system
                                                and play a critical role. Typical examples include cyber-physical
                                                systems that rely on machine learning in their perception (e.g.,
                                                analyzing camera images) and control (e.g., sending commands to
                                                actuators) layers. In my reflections, I will rely both on my analysis of
