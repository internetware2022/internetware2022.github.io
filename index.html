                        <h3>Welcome to Internetware 2022!</h3>
                        <p>Internetware 2022, the <em>13th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Internetware</em>, provides a forum
                            for researchers and practitioners to discuss the trending software technologies in the
                            Internet era.</p>
                        <p>Internet provides an open global infrastructure for exchanging and sharing resources for
                            people all over the world. The rapid development and the wide application of Internet make
                            it become a new mainstream platform for software to be used, developed, deployed, and
                            executed. With the vision of “Internet as a Computer”, many application styles such as
                            pervasive computing, grid computing, service computing, and cloud computing emerged in this
                            open and dynamic environment.</p>
                        <p>To support new forms of applications and accommodate the fundamental changes of the
                            underlying supporting platform, software technologies such as service-oriented architecture
                            are proposed for current practices. However, these popular technologies are far from
                            systematic and complete because no uniform software methodology and technology system like
                            the object-oriented one is provided.</p>
                        <p>Software in the Internet era should autonomously, cooperatively, situationally, emergently,
                            and trustworthily adapt to the new environment. The software entities dispersed on
                            distributed nodes over the Internet, which evolved from objects in object-oriented
                            methodology to software components (component-based software development), now are further
                            turned into self-contained, autonomous and adaptive software services in service-oriented
                            computing of state-of-arts. These software entities are coordinated statically and
                            dynamically in various interaction styles (passively and actively) such as integration,
                            cooperation, and orchestration to achieve flexible design objectives. So a so-called
                            “software-web” instead of information-web is weaved. This software-web as a whole can
                            perceive the changes of open, dynamic, and uncertain environments and respond to them in the
                            way of transforming architectures. Furthermore, the flexible design objective of the
                            software-web is reflected by its exhibiting several compatible goal-directed behaviors
                            according to its up-to-date knowledge about the outside environment.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, a portmanteau term “Internetware” is used to denote the future software-web in
                            open and dynamic environment, which can be defined as follows: an Internetware system is a
                            software system consists of the self-contained, autonomous entities situated in the
                            distributed nodes of Internet and the coordinators connecting these entities statically and
                            dynamically in various kinds of interaction styles (passively and actively). As a whole, an
                            Internetware system is able to perceive the changes of open and dynamic environment such as
                            Internet, respond to the changes in the way of architectural transformation, and exhibit
                            context-aware, adaptive and trustworthy behaviors in the open and dynamic environment in
                            order to meet its flexible design objectives. Internetware challenges many aspects of
                            software technologies, from operating platforms, programming models, to engineering
                            approaches, etc.</p>

                        <p>Internet is open, dynamic, and meets a constantly changing environment. Software, being
                            architected like the Internet, developed with the Internet, operated on the Internet,
                            connects the human, cyber, and physical world. Internetware ought to be autonomous,
                            cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, and trustworthy, but these requirements pose
                            unique challenges for software technologies to support Internetware's construction,
                            deployment, and use.</p>

                        <p>Software systems have been playing important roles in business, scientific research, and our
                            everyday lives. It
                            is
                            critical to improve both software productivity and quality, which are major challenges to
                            software engineering
                            researchers and practitioners. As developers work on a project, they leave behind many
                            digital artifacts. These
                            digital trails can provide insights into how software is developed and provide a rich source
                            of information to
                            help
                            improve development practices. For instance, GitHub hosts more than 57M repositories, and is
                            currently used by
                            more
                            than 20M developers. As another example, Stack Overflow has more than 3.9M registered users,
                            8.8M questions, and
                            41M
                            comments. The productivity of software developers and testers can be improved using
                            information from these
                            repositories.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, software engineering is benefiting from the rise of Artificial Intelligence
                            (AI) techniques
                            (e.g.,
                            machine learning and deep learning). These techniques have shown a great success in
                            addressing various software
                            engineering problems (e.g., code generation, code recommendation, and bug fix and repair).
                            Many papers have
                            applied
                            AI techniques to discover knowledge or build intelligent tools from software artifacts
                            (e.g., specifications,
                            source
                            code, documentations, execution logs, code commits and bug reports) to improve software
                            quality and development
                            process. Mining high quality knowledge from software artifacts is critical to building AI
                            tools. Thus, mining
                            software repositories to learn predictive and quality models is an important part in
                            intelligent software
                            engineering. For this special issue, we seek the full potential of AI on improving both
                            software productivity
                            and
                            quality.</p>

                        <p>We invite the submission of high-quality papers describing original and significant work in
